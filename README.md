# orbit-examples
Sample programs to compute a two-body orbit simulation in several computing languages.

This repository contains several programs which compute a two bodies orbit solution using numerical
methods. They are intended as an example of a "scientific" calculation done in several computing
languages, and its purpose its to be used as an example in a speech about numerical programming.

There is no guarantee about the accuracy of this program. Use it to launch expensive satellites 
at your own risk.
